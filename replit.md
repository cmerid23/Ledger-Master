## Architecture

### Artifacts

- `artifacts/clearledger` — React + Vite frontend (port assigned by Replit)
- `artifacts/api-server` — Express 5 API server (port 8080)

### Packages

- `lib/db` — Drizzle ORM schema (PostgreSQL), tables: users, businesses, accounts, transactions, journal_entries, journal_lines, reconciliations, reconciliation_matches, receipts
- `lib/api-spec` — OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`)
- `lib/api-client-react` — Orval-generated React Query hooks + Zod schemas

### Auth

- JWT tokens (jsonwebtoken + bcryptjs)
- Token stored in localStorage as `clearledger_token`
- Business ID stored as `clearledger_business_id`
- `setAuthTokenGetter` configured in `artifacts/clearledger/src/lib/auth.ts`
- JWT secret: `JWT_SECRET` env var or fallback

### Frontend Routing

- Vite proxies `/api/*` requests to `localhost:8080` (API server)
- Wouter for client-side routing
- Protected routes redirect to `/login` if no token
- After login, if no business selected, shows SelectBusiness page
